                <p>After having practiced yoga for three years,coming to realise that I need to step up my game,<br>
                if I ever want to progress. I am now focusing on rebuilding my foundations, admitting that I did practice<br>
                certain poses wrongly. I am not a yoga teacher, and this is for personal use only,but it is the only way I can fathom progressing.</p>

                <p>This website will lead you to and through different flows, all suited to build a foundation in strength and flexibility.<br>
                    In a <em>"choose your own adventure"</em> fashion, you will follow Alice down the Rabbit hole and make different choices<br>
                    that will ultimately lead you to your practice of that day.</p>

                <p><strong>To begin with, you choose between a path of either</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>strength</li>
                        <li>flexibility</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>For a full flow you then choose</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a warm-up + drill</li>
                        <li>full flow</li>
                        <li>playtime</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>You can of course also simply choose to only do the <em>warm-up + drill</em>, if you are only craving a short practice or want to flow on your own.<br>
                    If you want to go further, you progress from the <em>warm up</em> to the <em>full themed flow</em>> and end with a shavasana to finish off your practice.<br>
                    If you want to dive deeper into certain specific poses (e.g. strength: crow, chaturanga; flexibility: foward fold), you can add some <em>playtime</em><br>
                    to your practice.</playtime></p>
